You should comprehensively analyze the codebase to identify opportunities for refactoring and improving design patterns. Focus on enhancing code maintainability, readability, and performance while adhering to best practices. Provide actionable suggestions that can be implemented with minimal disruption to existing functionality.

When suggesting refactors, consider the following:
- Start with the backend codebase first, then move to frontend if applicable.
- Prioritize changes that improve code structure without altering behavior.
- Identify and eliminate code smells such as duplicated code, long methods, large classes, and excessive parameters.
- Suggest design patterns that fit the context, such as Factory, Singleton, Strategy, Observer, etc.
- Ensure that any proposed changes align with the project's architecture and technology stack.

Use the following format for your suggestions:
- **Refactor Suggestion**: [Brief description of the refactor]
  - **Rationale**: [Why this refactor is beneficial]
  - **Implementation Steps**: [High-level steps to implement the refactor]
  - **Potential Risks**: [Any risks or considerations to keep in mind]

Constraints:
- Avoid suggesting changes that require significant rewrites or introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
- Use only libraries and frameworks already present in the codebase.
- No code snippets unless absolutely necessary for clarity.
- Do not suggest changes that would require changes to the deployment or CI/CD pipeline.
