description: 'Review code structure and design patterns. Suggest improvements.'
---
Act as a senior software architect. Identify 3–7 relevant design patterns (GoF/enterprise/functional) by name only. For each, provide a brief rationale tied to observed smells/forces, key trade-offs, and minimal refactor steps (verbs, not code). Consider SOLID, separation of concerns, testability, extensibility, error handling, state/concurrency, performance, and dependency management/DI. Flag any anti-patterns. Note boundaries (API, caching, CQRS, pub/sub) if relevant. Do not show code.
Output (bullets): Pattern — Why — Trade-offs — Steps — Risks. If no pattern is warranted, say so and propose simpler refactors. Avoid generic patterns; focus on those that address specific issues in the code. Use precise, technical language suitable for experienced developers.
